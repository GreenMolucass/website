Adding the Google Translate widget to your static HTML site hosted on GitHub Pages involves a few straightforward steps. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

Step-by-Step Guide to Add Google Translate Widget
Get the Embed Code from Google Translate:

Go to Google Translate Website Translator.
Click on the "Add to your website now" button.
Set Up Your Translation Preferences:

Choose your original language (likely English).
Select the languages you want your site to be translated into (e.g., Indonesian).
Customize the appearance and behavior of the translation widget if needed.
Generate the Embed Code:

After configuring your preferences, click on the "Get Code" button.
Google Translate will generate a code snippet for you.
Insert the Code into Your HTML Pages:

Open your HTML file(s) using a text editor.
Find the place in your HTML where you want the widget to appear. Typically, it's placed in the <head> section or just before the closing </body> tag for better performance.
Paste the Code Snippet:

Copy the code snippet provided by Google Translate.
Paste it into your HTML file at the chosen location.
For example, if you want the translation widget to appear in the <head> section of your HTML:

html
Copy code
<head>
    <!-- Other meta tags and CSS links -->
    <!-- Paste your Google Translate code snippet here -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        function googleTranslateElementInit() {
            new google.translate.TranslateElement({pageLanguage: 'en', includedLanguages: 'id,en', layout: google.translate.TranslateElement.InlineLayout.SIMPLE}, 'google_translate_element');
        }
    </script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="//translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=googleTranslateElementInit"></script>
</head>
Or if you prefer placing it just before </body>:

html
Copy code
<body>
    <!-- Your HTML content -->
    
    <!-- Paste your Google Translate code snippet here -->
    <div id="google_translate_element"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        function googleTranslateElementInit() {
            new google.translate.TranslateElement({pageLanguage: 'en', includedLanguages: 'id,en', layout: google.translate.TranslateElement.InlineLayout.SIMPLE}, 'google_translate_element');
        }
    </script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="//translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=googleTranslateElementInit"></script>
</body>
Save and Commit Changes:

Save your HTML file after adding the Google Translate code snippet.
If you're using GitHub Pages, commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository.
Verify the Widget:

Visit your site and verify that the Google Translate widget appears as expected.
Test the translation functionality to ensure it works correctly for your chosen languages.
Additional Notes:
Google Translate will dynamically translate the content of your site based on the user's selection. This approach is easy to implement and works well for static HTML sites.
Ensure that your HTML file is correctly formatted and that the script tags are placed in appropriate sections to avoid rendering issues.
Depending on your site's layout and design, you might need to adjust CSS styles to ensure the widget integrates seamlessly with your site's theme.
By following these steps, you can effectively add the Google Translate widget to your static HTML site hosted on GitHub Pages, enabling translation capabilities for your users.
