<h1>Internship Information:</h1>
<p>Green Moluccas is a non-profit organization established in 2011 in Moluccas Province, Indonesia, with the primary objective of environmental preservation, heightened societal awareness, and empowerment in the realms of environment and disaster management. Its overarching goal is to foster a sustainable way of life for future generations. Green Moluccas enhances societal empowerment through education, training, and socialization, aiming to safeguard the environment. Green Moluccas achieves its missions through three primary initiatives: green education, social enterprise, and campaigning and advocacy.</p>

<h1>Green Education</h1>
<p>This program aims to enhance the environmental and disaster management knowledge of marginalized children in Moluccas Province through the implementation of green education. This program is specifically designed for children between the ages of 8 and 14 in the Moluccas region. Participants will engage in enjoyable activities within the mangrove forest located in Ambon Bay, where they will undertake a mini-project centered around environmental topics. This program aims to cultivate sustainability and empower individuals to become catalysts for change within their community. Individuals have the capacity to utilize their acquired knowledge in order to safeguard and maintain the environment.</p>

<h1>Social Enterprise</h1>
<p>The social enterprise program aims to enhance the economic growth of society by implementing a circular economy program. Individuals will acquire knowledge regarding the process of transforming waste into valuable commodities. Furthermore, participants will receive training in the process of recycling waste materials into valuable products, such as compost, plastic souvenirs, ecobricks, and other related items. This program also educates the community about waste banks, providing information on how individuals can generate income by bringing their waste and converting it into money or valuable items for their households. Another initiative involves the acquisition of pre-owned items, catering to individuals who prioritize environmental sustainability or have a vested interest in pre-owned goods. The objective is to enhance the societal economy by means of education, socialization, and training.</p>

<h1>Advocacy and Campaign</h1>
<p>The program's primary goals encompass the augmentation of societal consciousness via social media and offline initiatives and the promotion of environmental concerns in Moluccas to pertinent stakeholders. The Green Moluccas region actively engages in the celebration and organization of environmental events, including the establishment of environmental competitions and participation in international movements such as Friday for the Future and World Clean Up Day. Green Moluccas has implemented a program to safeguard the coastal environment. This program includes initiatives such as mangrove plantations and the adoption of mangroves for protection purposes. Green Moluccas collaborates with various institutions to safeguard the environment, including participating in coral reef plantation projects with the NAVY, engaging in beach cleanup initiatives with other institutions, and planting trees in the catchment area of Moluccas.</p>
